# hello-world
This is a test repository to store code and other things. Just tryna learn how to use this. 

Hey I'm changing the readme here in the branched file. Then I can later merge them together but now both are saved. This could be useful if I ever want to go back to an old version of code. It could also allow me to putll code from a git repository onto a server and then run the code from there. That would be pro because the actual scripts are not large only the data which can also be uploaded. cool!
